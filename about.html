I'm a mum of two, and a certified Relaxation & Sophrology Therapist

-consulting online and in-person, in French and English. I specialise
for children and expats/immigrants, and I have a special interest in
offering complementary health therapy solutions to people dealing with
cancer, long COVID, ADHD, sleep issues, depression, burn-out, and any
chronic health conditions where stress and pain are major triggers.

            My Approach
          </h2>

<p>
Sophro by Nature was born from my passion for People and Nature, and
my desire to promote a healthier and deeper connection between our
body and mind, and the world around us. Sophro comes from the Greek
"Sos" and "Phren" meaning awareness/balance of the Body-mind
connection, and "by Nature" refers to the fact that this
connection/awareness is natural - it is all within ourselves.
</p>
‍
<p>
I use relaxation therapy along a holistic therapeutic method - called
sophrology - that combines classic relaxation techniques with mindset
coaching, and which blends the best of Western science (hypnotherapy,
positive & behavioural psychology, relaxation techniques, guided
imagery, NLP, counselling skills) and Eastern traditions (mindfulness,
yoga, breathing, visualisation, meditation) to balance the body-mind
connection and provide a more serene approach to life challenges. (see
FAQ for more info on Sophrology).
</p>
‍
<p>
All the techniques I use are advocated for by the NHS on their website
and have been shown to be effective by research studies - my own
background is in languages and in science with a (honour) MSc in
Environmental Studies and Ecotourism from Edinburgh Napier University.
I spent over 400 hours in training and supervised therapy for over two
years in a state-accredited school in France to become a Relaxation
and Sophrology Therapist :)

            About Me
          </h2>

<p>
After I became a mum for the first time in the US, I was looking for a
new way of being a working mother. When we moved to Luxembourg, I set
up a project coming from my heart: working with children (babies and
preschoolers) and their families. This led me to create my own
Professional Training Center in Language Development and Nature
Education in Luxembourg.

Thanks to this experience, I've worked with people of all ages, walks
of life, cultures and nationalities - parents and babies, young
children with special needs, mums and dads to be, grandparents,
language therapists, and early-years educators.
</p>
‍
<p>
Working with parents and children also naturally led me to understand
the importance of a healthy lifestyle, general well-being, and the
huge impact of stress and mindset on parenthood, health, and life in
general. This is what started my life-long mission, and prompted me to
train as a Relaxation and Sophrology Therapist: to provide support and
ways to alleviate stress-related issues that I witnessed - much too
often - in people's daily lives.

My own experience living and working in various countries with
different cultures expanded my cultural and diversity sensitivity -
this is why I chose to specialise with children, families, and
especially expatriates/immigrants and Third Culture Kids.
</p>

<p>
What I love most about my work is the flexible and therapeutic nature
of the methods I use; one day I can prepare a pregnant mum for birth
and dealing with pain and fear, the day after I can help a child deal
with stress and anxiety, the next day I can help a client improve
sleep issues, and the following day I can provide emotional and pain
relief to someone going through chemotherapy... It is never boring and
always feels so rewarding! As a holistic practitioner, I enjoy taking
into account all aspect of your life(style), so that I can provide
tools and techniques to empower but also guide you to another way of
being yourself - a happier self :)
</p>

<p>
I've always be a Nature lover (I was a Climbing Instructor and trained
in Primitive Skills and Nature Education too), and I combine this
important value of mine with relaxation and sophrology when I design
sessions for my clients, as I firmly believe that the natural world -
our world - is a great source of appeasement.
</p>

<p>
In my spare time, I enjoy running, gardening, spending time in Nature,
photography, reading, crafting with my kids, looking after my cats,
guinea pig and hens, and experimenting with fermented food.
</p>
‍
<p>
And I am now furthering my training to be a Counsellor :)
